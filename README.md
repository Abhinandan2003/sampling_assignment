Sampling
Sampling is a method used to glean insights about a population by analyzing statistics from a representative subset, sparing the need to examine every individual. To tackle an initial dataset imbalance—763 non-fraudulent cases and only 9 fraudulent cases—an oversampling approach was implemented. This involved generating additional instances of the minority class (fraudulent cases) to match the majority class (non-fraudulent cases), resulting in a balanced dataset consolidated into a single data frame.

The following sampling techniques were utilized:

Simple Random Sampling: Random selection of samples from the population.
Systematic Sampling: Regular interval selection after a random start.
Cluster Sampling: Randomly selecting clusters from the population.
Stratified Sampling: Division of the population into subgroups based on certain criteria.
Bootstrap Sampling: Resampling with replacement to create multiple samples from the original dataset.
