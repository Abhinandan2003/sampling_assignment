# Sampling in Data Analysis

Sampling is a methodology employed to gain insights into a population by analyzing statistics derived from a representative subset, thereby eliminating the need to examine each individual. To address the initial imbalance in the dataset, where there were 763 non-fraudulent cases and only 9 fraudulent cases, an oversampling approach was implemented. This approach involved generating additional instances of the minority class (fraudulent cases) to match the size of the majority class (non-fraudulent cases), resulting in a balanced dataset consolidated into a single data frame.

## Utilized Sampling Techniques:

1. **Simple Random Sampling:**
   - Involves randomly selecting samples from the population.

2. **Systematic Sampling:**
   - Entails regular interval selection after a random start.

3. **Cluster Sampling:**
   - Randomly selects clusters from the population.

4. **Stratified Sampling:**
   - Divides the population into subgroups based on certain criteria.

5. **Bootstrap Sampling:**
   - Resamples with replacement to create multiple samples from the original dataset.

These various sampling techniques were employed to ensure the representation of diverse subsets of the data, facilitating a more robust analysis and addressing the initial class imbalance.
